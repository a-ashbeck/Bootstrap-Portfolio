                    Alan is a 7 year veteran in the field of behavioral interventions, and has been working with mobile and web-based applications for the last 2 years. His goals are to push the envelope of on these interventions by creating eHealth and mHealth tech to help further the science of behavioral intervention, and to help individuals struggling with mental illness. Seeing a need for a development/coding background in order to advance his career, Alan took a job at the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CBITs) at Northwestern University, where he currently works. He has recently enrolled in a coding boot camp at Northwestern University in order to further his career as a developer of behavioral science tech products.

                  Great! You are still with me. If you have made it this far, this is the point where my story takes a turn for the weird. In an effort to create more content about myself, I have decided to tell you the story about the one summer in the embarrassingly not-to-distant-past that I decided to take up Magic: The Gathering. I could tell you that it was all fun and games (knee slapper), but that would be a lie.

                  In actuality, I became obsessed with creating the perfect deck at nearly any cost, and subsequently built up an obscene amount of debt. That was not fun! Do you know what it is like to have a deck so expensive you don't want to  play it? Worse yet... no one wants to play you because it's no fun to play your deck?
