              Great! You are still with me. If you have made it this far, this is the point where my story takes a turn for the weird. In an effort to create more content about myself, I have decided to tell you the story about the one summer in the embarrassingly not-to-distant-past that I decided to take up Magic: The Gathering. I could tell you that it was all fun and games (knee slapper), but that would be a lie.

              In actuality, I became obsessed with creating the perfect deck at nearly any cost, and subsequently built up an obscene amount of debt. That was not fun! Do you know what it is like to have a deck so expensive you don't want to  play it? Worse yet... no one wants to play you because it's no fun to play your deck?
